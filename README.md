# new-servers
todo lists for various OS and services, required to secure new installations

# why?
for those of us who like doing things by hand, but prefer to automate specific tasks that can be easily replicated on new installations and other OS's

# target?
improved security, botnet avoidance, and exhaustive compromise capture. differences bewteen OS's that achieve the same ends, better continuity

# how?
VPS compromised soon after installation setup, and the poor audit due to default settings of common OS's, things that control panels dont allow to modify
